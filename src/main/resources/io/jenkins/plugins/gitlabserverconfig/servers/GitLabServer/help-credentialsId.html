<div>

  You can create your own <a href="https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens">personal
  access token</a>.
  <br><br>

  Token should be registered with scopes:
  <ul>
    <li><b>api</b> - For read/write access to the API, including all groups and projects</li>
    <li><b>repo</b> - For read-only access to the authenticated user's profile through the /user API
      endpoint, which includes username, public email, and full name
    </li>
  </ul>

  In Jenkins, create a token credential as «<b>GitLab Personal Access Token</b>». Human readable id
  and description is recommended.
  <br/>

  <p>
    If you have an existing GitLab login and password you can convert it to a token automatically
    with the help of <br>
    «<b>Manage additional GitLab actions</b>» in Advanced section of GitLab Servers.
  </p>
