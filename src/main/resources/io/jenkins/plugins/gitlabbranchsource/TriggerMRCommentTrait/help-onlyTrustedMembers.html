  If checked only trusted members of project can trigger MR. Trusted members mean members with Developer/Maintainer access (also includes inherited from ancestor groups) in the project.
  You may want to disable this option because trusted members do not include members inherited from shared group (there is no way to get it from GitLabApi as of GitLab 13.0.0).
  If disabled, MR comment trigger can be done by any user having access to your project.
