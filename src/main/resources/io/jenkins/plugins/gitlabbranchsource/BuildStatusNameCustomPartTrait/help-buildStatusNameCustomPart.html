<div>
  Enter a string to customize the status/context name for status updates published to GitLab.
  For a branch build the default name would be 'jenkinsci/branch'. With the buildStatusNameCustomPart
  'custom' the name would be 'jenkinsci/custom/branch'.
  This allows to have multiple GitLab-Branch-Sources for the same GitLab-project configured.
