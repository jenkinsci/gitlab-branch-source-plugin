  Determines which branches are discovered.
  <dl>
    <dt>Only branches that are not also filed as MRs</dt>
    <dd>
      If you are discovering origin merge requests, it may not make sense to discover the same
      changes both as a
      merge request and as a branch.
    </dd>
    <dt>Only branches that are also filed as MRs</dt>
    <dd>
      This option exists to preserve legacy behaviour when upgrading from older versions of the
      plugin.
      NOTE: If you have an actual use case for this option please file a merge request against this
      text.
    </dd>
    <dt>All branches</dt>
    <dd>
      Ignores whether the branch is also filed as a merge request and instead discovers all branches
      on the
      origin project.
    </dd>
