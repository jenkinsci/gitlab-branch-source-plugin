<div>
    Determines how merge requests are discovered:
    <ul>
        <li>Discover each merge request once with the discovered revision corresponding to the result of merging with the
            current revision of the target branch
        </li>
        <li>Discover each merge request once with the discovered revision corresponding to the merge request head revision
            without merging
        </li>
        <li>Discover each merge request twice. The first discovered revision corresponds to the result of merging with
            the current revision of the target branch in each scan. The second parallel discovered revision corresponds
            to the merge request head revision without merging
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
