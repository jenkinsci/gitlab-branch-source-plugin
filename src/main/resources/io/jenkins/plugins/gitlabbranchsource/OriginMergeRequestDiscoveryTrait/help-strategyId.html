<div>
  Determines how merge requests are discovered:
  <ul>
    <li>Discover each merge request once with the discovered revision corresponding to the result of
      merging with the
      current revision of the target branch
    </li>
    <li>Discover each merge request once with the discovered revision corresponding to the merge
      request head revision
      without merging
    </li>
    <li>Discover each merge request twice. The first discovered revision corresponds to the result
      of merging with
      the current revision of the target branch in each scan. The second parallel discovered
      revision corresponds
      to the merge request head revision without merging
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
