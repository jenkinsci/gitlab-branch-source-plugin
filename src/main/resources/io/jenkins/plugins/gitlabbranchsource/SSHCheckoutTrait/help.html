  By default the discovered branches / merge requests will all use the same username / password
  credentials
  that were used for discovery when checking out sources. This means that the checkout will be using
  the
  <code>https://</code> protocol for the Git repository.
  <p>
    This behaviour allows you to select the SSH private key to be used for checking out sources,
    which will
    consequently force the checkout to use the <code>ssh://</code> protocol.
